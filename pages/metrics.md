title: Metrics
---
For each goal, list metrics (things that you could observe) that would show
that you are making progress on that problem.

These can be qualitative or quantitative, for example: stakeholders understand
key points after a workshop or project leads spend less time building
processes that fit their needs.

## Example

- **Metrics for goal 1**: Stakeholders understand key points after a workshop,
  spread messages at home agency/office
- **Metrics for goal 2**: Project leads spend less time choosing or building
  processes that fit their project needs
