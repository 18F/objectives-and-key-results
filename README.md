## Objectives and Key Results guide - DRAFT

[18F](https://18f.gsa.gov) encourages the development of Objectives and Key
Results (OKRs) as a way to define and track goals and the results that
indicate you’ve reached those goals.

The [lean movement](https://pages.18f.gov/lean-product-design/) encourages
focusing team efforts on **outcomes** (the impact we’re trying to accomplish)
instead of just **outputs** (what we’re doing). This is a quick guide to
creating OKRs in that spirit.

This document is based on the [18F Guides
Template](https://pages.18f.gov/guides-template/), published using the [18F
Pages](https://github.com/18F/pages/) platform. Please refer to the published
Guides Template or the source repository,
[18F/guides-template](https://github.com/18F/guides-template/), for details on
how to update this guide.
