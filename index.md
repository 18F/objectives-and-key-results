[18F](https://18f.gsa.gov) encourages the development of Objectives and Key
Results (OKRs) as a way to define and track goals and the results that
indicate you’ve reached those goals.

The [lean movement](https://pages.18f.gov/lean-product-design/) encourages
focusing team efforts on **outcomes** (the impact we’re trying to accomplish)
instead of just **outputs** (what we’re doing). This is a quick guide to
creating OKRs in that spirit.

**18F team members:** You can use the [Google Doc
template](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/document/d/1yqZ20GSLVUmw5ewkug7XLAVge4aKNgGRjQLLJiIvrPo/edit?usp=sharing)
as a working document as you progress through this guide.
